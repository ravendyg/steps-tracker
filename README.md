## Steps Tracker

A simple app to claculate how many kilometers I walked in each pair of boots.

Sound crazy, but yeah I'm interested to know it ).

No cool design. No architecture. Just needed the app and to get familiar with Dart/Flutter.

## TODO
* Make created boots name editable.
* Move the last updated pair to the left.
* Add an option to enter steps with conversion to kilometers. Would require settings page with conversion coefficient.
* Add statistics. E.g. time / boots slices.
